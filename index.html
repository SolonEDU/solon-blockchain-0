            <h1 class="title">Who Are We?</h1>
            <p>We are a small group of students working at Bushwick Generator, a “community-led innovation lab” that
                aims to introduce modern technology into new industries for a better future. We have chosen to create a
                project centered on improving schools, especially in neighborhoods where there may be a disconnect
                between students, parents, and teachers.</p>

            <h1 class="title">What Is Solon?</h1>
            <p>Solon is an educational tool that runs using DAOs (decentralized autonomous organizations) and is
                currently in its early stages. A DAO is an organization and platform in which members can vote on the
                proposals presented by other members in the community enforced by smart contracts. Smart contracts are
                essentially coded agreements that can be used to automate transactions. Solon is a platform we founded
                to address issues regarding authority in our schools.</p>
            <br>
            <p>As a Decentralized Autonomous Platform, Solon is dedicated to ensuring greater communications and
                efficiency among the students, teachers and parents in New York City’s schools.</p>

            <h1 class="title">What Can It Be Used For?</h1>
            <p>Currently, our primary goals are to create a platform where students, teachers, school administrators,
                and/or parents can:</p>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>Vote on policy proposals and budgeting</li>
                <li>Organize school-wide acitivities, such as trips or events like bake sales</li>
                <li>Administer clubs</li>
                <li>Upload or view grades</li>
                <li>Manage school surveys for students and parents</li>
                <li>Easily take care of payments for things like textbooks or field trip fees</li>
                <li>Communicate with each other with ease</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>In the near future, we hope to expand Solon to encompass aspects that can improve the experiences of
                everyone involved.</p>

            <h1 class="title">How Can We Be Sure It Is Safe?</h1>
            <p>We plan to build Solon through an operating system call DAOstack, which powers various online
                decentralized autonomous platforms. The base of this system is blockchain technology which consists of
                “blocks” of records and information. Modifying one block of information would have required other
                subsequent and previous blocks to be altered, making this system resistant to common problems like
                fraud. Blockchain technology is designed in a way that defies data alteration, making it more secure
                than other traditional central databases.</p>
